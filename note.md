# Lecture 1  
<strong>unsupervised learning</strong> - data samples are not labeled, model capture the pattern hidden in data Example: clustering, dimensionality reduction, distribution learning.  
<strong>supervised learning</strong> - data samples are labeled, model describes the relation between data samples and their labels  
Example: classification, regression  
<strong>reinforcement learning</strong> - data samples are series of actions, states and rewards. We are looking for optimal policy that maximizes future returns.  
Example: playing games, control robots

<strong>Soft K mean</strong>  
Soft K -means clustering treats the cluster assignments as probability distributions over the clusters.

Random variables x and y are independent if P(x,y) = P(x)P(y)  
i.i.d. sequence: X1,...,Xn are independent and identically distributed if they are independent and have the same distribution (same mean and standard deviation)

<strong>Probability Mass Function</strong>  
PMF describes the probability of each specific outcome of a discrete random variable.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ee93400-75dc-46cf-9fe5-1fb81f7914c2)  
Examples:  If x is the result of rolling a fair 5-sided die:  
P(X=x) = 1/6, x = 1,2,3,4,5,6 or = 0 otherwise  
<br>  
<strong>Probability Density Function</strong>  
PDF describes the likelihood if a continuous random variable taking on a value within an interval. Unlike PMF, it does not give direct probabilities but rather a density

<strong>Gaussian Distribution</strong>  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73585695-713b-4fa8-8604-68ca6308fb0e)  
Why Gaussian?  
1. Many processes in nature are approximately Gaussian
2. Sum of large enough independent random objects tends to a Gaussian object
3. Superposition of Gaussians can describe a large class of distributions
<br>

<strong>Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)</strong>
S(Œº,Œ£) is the log of the likelihood function normalized by the number of samples ùëÅ. Taking the log of the likelihood simplifies calculations, especially for large datasets, and normalization makes it more manageable to interpret
