# Lecture 1  
<strong>unsupervised learning</strong> - data samples are not labeled, model capture the pattern hidden in data Example: clustering, dimensionality reduction, distribution learning.  
<strong>supervised learning</strong> - data samples are labeled, model describes the relation between data samples and their labels  
Example: classification, regression  
<strong>reinforcement learning</strong> - data samples are series of actions, states and rewards. We are looking for optimal policy that maximizes future returns.  
Example: playing games, control robots

<strong>Soft K mean</strong>  
Soft K -means clustering treats the cluster assignments as probability distributions over the clusters.
